Learning how to navigate GitHub

Hello future employers!  My name is Martin Hayford and I have recently graduated from Roosevelt University in Chicago IL with a BS in Mathematics (concentration in statistics) and minors in Computer Science and History.  I am not the most prolific coder, but I will be uploading/hosting my projects on GitHub in order to display my abilities.
Most of my coding experience is in C# GUI development for my current part-time employer.  I have developed a few small business utilities and am working on more.  My main strength is my mathematical literacy and ability to create mathematical algorithms.  I am working hard to develop my R skills in order to fully take advantage of my math knowlegde.
